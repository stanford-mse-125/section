    "# Discussion 2: More Pandas and Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to MS&E 125 Discussions! Discussions are an opportunity to get hands-on experience with material from lecture, as well as prepare you for completing the homework assignments. Completing the discussions is optional, and we will not be collecting them. However, we strongly encourage you to work through the discussions, as we feel that they are the best way to learn the material. Additionally, attending the discussion sections gives you the opportunity to get support from the course TAs as needed and help you stay on top of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for each discussion notebook to be fully contained so that you can work through the discussions on your own. When completing a discussion, you should work through the whole notebook, reading all text components and running all code cells. Additionally, there will be some exercises in the notebook for you to complete to make sure you are understanding the material."

    "We're now going to switch gears and talk about sampling. Sampling is an extremely important tool for any statistician, and is the workhorse of several very important data science topics including [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#:~:text=Monte%20Carlo%20methods%2C%20or%20Monte,might%20be%20deterministic%20in%20principle.), [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)), and [numerical linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra). *Sampling* can be defined as the process of collecting a random set of observations from some population. What the population is that we are sampling from is most crucial. "
